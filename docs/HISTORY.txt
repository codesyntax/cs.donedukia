Changelog for cs.donedukia

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

cs.donedukia - 0.4
    - The icon in Plone 2.5.x should be folder_icon.gif and not
      folder.gif because of its size.
      [erral]

    - Removed the unused attribute showContents to show the contents 
      of the current DonEdukia. If you want to show the contents
      register a new view. It's not so dificult :)
